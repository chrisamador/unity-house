# Layer 8: Integrations and Extensibility Testing Plan

This document outlines the testing approach for Layer 8 of the Unity House implementation, focusing on integrations, extensibility, public API, and plugins.

## Backend Tests (Convex-test with Vitest)

### Public API Tests

- Test API authentication and authorization
- Test rate limiting and quota enforcement
- Test API versioning and backward compatibility
- Test error handling and response formats
- Test API documentation accuracy

### Webhook Tests

- Test webhook registration and configuration
- Test webhook event triggering
- Test webhook payload delivery and retries
- Test webhook signature verification
- Test webhook logging and monitoring

### Plugin System Tests

- Test plugin registration and installation
- Test plugin lifecycle management (install, update, disable, uninstall)
- Test plugin isolation and security boundaries
- Test plugin configuration and settings
- Test plugin performance impact

### Third-party Integration Tests

- Test authentication with third-party services
- Test data synchronization with external systems
- Test error handling for external service failures
- Test integration configuration management
- Test integration health monitoring

## End-to-End Tests (Playwright)

### API Management Flows

- Test API key generation and management
- Test API usage monitoring and analytics
- Test API documentation and explorer interfaces
- Test API permission management
- Test API version selection

### Webhook Configuration Flows

- Test creating and configuring webhooks
- Test webhook event selection
- Test webhook testing and validation
- Test webhook delivery logs and debugging
- Test webhook security settings

### Plugin Marketplace Flows

- Test browsing and searching for plugins
- Test plugin installation and configuration
- Test plugin settings management
- Test plugin updates and version management
- Test plugin uninstallation and cleanup

### Integration Management Flows

- Test connecting to third-party services
- Test authorizing integrations with OAuth
- Test configuring integration settings
- Test monitoring integration status
- Test troubleshooting integration issues

## Test Data Setup

For backend tests, we'll set up test data including:

- Sample API clients with different permission levels
- Mock webhook endpoints for delivery testing
- Sample plugins with different capabilities
- Mock third-party services for integration testing

## Running Tests

To run the tests for Layer 8:

```bash
# Run backend tests
bun run test:backend -- publicApi.test.ts webhooks.test.ts plugins.test.ts integrations.test.ts

# Run E2E tests
bun run test:e2e -- apiManagement.spec.ts webhookConfiguration.spec.ts pluginMarketplace.spec.ts integrationManagement.spec.ts

# Run all Layer 8 tests
bun run test:layer8
```

Add this script to the root `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:layer8": "bun run test:backend -- publicApi.test.ts webhooks.test.ts plugins.test.ts integrations.test.ts && bun run test:e2e -- apiManagement.spec.ts webhookConfiguration.spec.ts pluginMarketplace.spec.ts integrationManagement.spec.ts"
  }
}
```
