# Unity House Testing Strategy Summary

This document provides an overview of the testing strategy for the Unity House application across all implementation layers.

## Testing Philosophy

Our testing approach follows these key principles:

1. **User-Centric**: Tests focus on real user flows and behaviors rather than implementation details
2. **Behavior-Driven**: Tests verify what users expect to happen, not how it happens
3. **Maintainable**: Tests are resilient to refactoring and implementation changes
4. **Efficient**: Tests run quickly and provide meaningful feedback

## Testing Tools

- **Backend Testing**: Convex-test with Vitest
  - Mocks the Convex backend environment
  - Tests database schema, queries, mutations, and actions
  - Verifies permissions and data integrity

- **End-to-End Testing**: Playwright
  - Tests complete user flows across the application
  - Verifies UI behavior and interactions
  - Tests integration between frontend and backend

## Test Structure

Each implementation layer has its own testing plan that includes:

1. **Backend Tests**: Focused on data models, business logic, and permissions
2. **End-to-End Tests**: Focused on user flows and interactions
3. **Test Data Setup**: Helpers for creating test data
4. **Running Instructions**: Commands to execute the tests

## Layer-Specific Testing Focus

1. **Layer 1: Core Infrastructure**
   - Authentication flows
   - Project structure and configuration
   - Basic navigation and routing

2. **Layer 2: Basic Entity Management**
   - User management
   - Organization management
   - Entity creation and management
   - Basic permissions

3. **Layer 3: Dynamic Page System**
   - Page creation and editing
   - Page templates
   - Custom components
   - Page rendering

4. **Layer 4: Domain Resolution and Multi-tenancy**
   - Custom domain configuration
   - Theming
   - White-labeling
   - Multi-tenant isolation

5. **Layer 5: Advanced Permissions and Workflows**
   - Role-based access control
   - Permission groups
   - Approval workflows
   - Collaboration features

6. **Layer 6: AI Integration**
   - Content generation
   - Semantic search
   - Personalization
   - AI service integration

7. **Layer 7: Analytics and Reporting**
   - Data collection
   - Report generation
   - Dashboards
   - User insights

8. **Layer 8: Integrations and Extensibility**
   - Public API
   - Webhooks
   - Plugin system
   - Third-party integrations

## Running Tests

Tests can be run for individual layers or for the entire application:

```bash
# Run tests for a specific layer
bun run test:layer1
bun run test:layer2
# ... and so on

# Run all backend tests
bun run test:backend

# Run all E2E tests
bun run test:e2e

# Run all tests
bun run test
```

## Test Data Management

- Backend tests use helper functions to set up test data
- E2E tests use test fixtures to create consistent environments
- Test data is isolated between test runs to prevent interference

## Future Enhancements

As the application matures, the testing strategy can be enhanced with:

1. **CI/CD Integration**: Automated test runs on pull requests and deployments
2. **Visual Regression Testing**: Ensuring UI consistency across changes
3. **Performance Testing**: Verifying application performance under load
4. **Accessibility Testing**: Ensuring the application is accessible to all users
5. **Security Testing**: Verifying the application's security posture
