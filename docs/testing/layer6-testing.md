# Layer 6: AI Integration Testing Plan

This document outlines the testing approach for Layer 6 of the Unity House implementation, focusing on AI integration features including content generation, semantic search, and personalization.

## Backend Tests (Convex-test with Vitest)

### AI Content Generation Tests

- Test generating content with AI based on different prompts
- Test content generation with different parameters (length, tone, style)
- Test error handling for AI service failures
- Test rate limiting and quota management
- Test content filtering and moderation

### Semantic Search Tests

- Test indexing content for semantic search
- Test search relevance with different queries
- Test search filtering by content type, date, and other metadata
- Test search result ranking and scoring
- Test handling of misspellings and synonyms

### Personalization Tests

- Test user preference tracking and storage
- Test content recommendations based on user behavior
- Test personalized search results
- Test A/B testing framework for personalization strategies
- Test user segmentation and targeting

### AI Integration Infrastructure Tests

- Test AI service connection and authentication
- Test caching mechanisms for AI responses
- Test fallback strategies when AI services are unavailable
- Test monitoring and observability of AI service usage

## End-to-End Tests (Playwright)

### Content Generation Flows

- Test AI-assisted content creation in the page editor
- Test generating content variations and selecting preferred options
- Test AI suggestions for titles, descriptions, and meta tags
- Test AI-generated responses to comments or messages
- Test that generated content maintains proper formatting and structure

### Semantic Search Flows

- Test search interface with various query types
- Test search filters and facets
- Test search result display and pagination
- Test search analytics and trending searches
- Test search personalization based on user history

### Personalization Flows

- Test personalized content recommendations on dashboards
- Test personalized navigation and UI elements
- Test user preference settings and their effect on the experience
- Test personalized notifications and alerts
- Test opt-out mechanisms for personalization features

## Test Data Setup

For backend tests, we'll set up test data including:

- Sample content for indexing and searching
- User profiles with preference data
- Mock AI service responses for deterministic testing
- Test prompts and expected outputs for content generation

## Running Tests

To run the tests for Layer 6:

```bash
# Run backend tests
bun run test:backend -- aiContent.test.ts semanticSearch.test.ts personalization.test.ts aiInfrastructure.test.ts

# Run E2E tests
bun run test:e2e -- contentGeneration.spec.ts semanticSearch.spec.ts personalization.spec.ts

# Run all Layer 6 tests
bun run test:layer6
```

Add this script to the root `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:layer6": "bun run test:backend -- aiContent.test.ts semanticSearch.test.ts personalization.test.ts aiInfrastructure.test.ts && bun run test:e2e -- contentGeneration.spec.ts semanticSearch.spec.ts personalization.spec.ts"
  }
}
```
