# Layer 7: Analytics and Reporting Testing Plan

This document outlines the testing approach for Layer 7 of the Unity House implementation, focusing on analytics and reporting features.

## Backend Tests (Convex-test with Vitest)

### Analytics Data Collection Tests

- Test event tracking for custom events
- Test user property tracking and updates
- Test data validation and sanitization
- Test handling of high-volume analytics events

### Analytics Processing Tests

- Test aggregation of analytics data
- Test time-based analytics calculations (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Test user segmentation based on behavior
- Test funnel analysis and conversion tracking
- Test data retention and privacy compliance

### Reporting API Tests

- Test generating reports with different parameters
- Test report data accuracy and consistency
- Test report caching and performance
- Test scheduled report generation
- Test report access permissions

### Dashboard Configuration Tests

- Test creating custom dashboards
- Test adding and configuring widgets
- Test dashboard sharing and permissions
- Test dashboard data refresh mechanisms
- Test dashboard export functionality

## End-to-End Tests (Playwright)

### Analytics Dashboard Flows

- Test viewing analytics dashboards with different date ranges
- Test filtering analytics data by various dimensions
- Test interactive charts and data visualizations
- Test exporting analytics data in different formats
- Test dashboard customization and layout changes

### Report Generation Flows

- Test creating custom reports with different metrics
- Test scheduling recurring reports
- Test report delivery via email and other channels
- Test report visualization options
- Test report sharing with team members

### User Insights Flows

- Test viewing user profiles with activity history
- Test user segmentation and cohort analysis
- Test user journey visualization
- Test identifying high-value users and engagement patterns
- Test privacy controls and data anonymization

### Content Performance Flows

- Test content performance analytics
- Test A/B test results analysis
- Test content engagement metrics
- Test conversion attribution
- Test content recommendation effectiveness

## Test Data Setup

For backend tests, we'll set up test data including:

- Sample user activity events
- Historical analytics data for trend analysis
- Mock report configurations
- Sample dashboard layouts and widgets

## Running Tests

To run the tests for Layer 7:

```bash
# Run backend tests
bun run test:backend -- analyticsCollection.test.ts analyticsProcessing.test.ts reporting.test.ts dashboards.test.ts

# Run E2E tests
bun run test:e2e -- analyticsDashboard.spec.ts reportGeneration.spec.ts userInsights.spec.ts contentPerformance.spec.ts

# Run all Layer 7 tests
bun run test:layer7
```

Add this script to the root `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:layer7": "bun run test:backend -- analyticsCollection.test.ts analyticsProcessing.test.ts reporting.test.ts dashboards.test.ts && bun run test:e2e -- analyticsDashboard.spec.ts reportGeneration.spec.ts userInsights.spec.ts contentPerformance.spec.ts"
  }
}
```
