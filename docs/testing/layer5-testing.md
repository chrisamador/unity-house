# Layer 5: Advanced Permissions and Workflows Testing Plan

This document outlines the testing approach for Layer 5 of the Unity House implementation, focusing on advanced permissions and workflows.

## Backend Tests (Convex-test with Vitest)

### Role-Based Access Control Tests

- Test that users with different roles have appropriate access to resources
- Test role inheritance and hierarchies
- Test custom role creation and assignment
- Test permission checks at different levels (organization, entity, page)

### Permission Group Tests

- Test creating permission groups that bundle multiple permissions
- Test assigning permission groups to users and roles
- Test that permissions are correctly applied when using groups
- Test updating permission groups and verifying changes propagate

### Approval Workflow Tests

- Test creating approval workflows with multiple steps
- Test submitting content for approval
- Test approval/rejection at each step in the workflow
- Test notifications for pending approvals
- Test bypassing workflows for users with override permissions

### Collaboration Tests

- Test concurrent editing with conflict resolution
- Test commenting and feedback systems
- Test activity tracking and audit logs
- Test user mentions and notifications

## End-to-End Tests (Playwright)

### Role Management Flows

- Test creating custom roles with specific permissions
- Test assigning roles to users
- Test that UI elements are properly shown/hidden based on user roles
- Test that actions are properly enabled/disabled based on permissions

### Permission Group Management Flows

- Test creating and configuring permission groups
- Test assigning permission groups to users
- Test that permissions are correctly applied in the UI
- Test that permission changes are reflected immediately

### Approval Workflow Flows

- Test creating multi-step approval workflows
- Test the content submission process
- Test the approval/rejection process at each step
- Test that appropriate users can see pending approvals
- Test that content state changes correctly through the workflow

### Collaboration Flows

- Test real-time collaboration features
- Test commenting and feedback functionality
- Test activity history and audit logs
- Test user mentions and notifications

## Test Data Setup

For backend tests, we'll set up test data including:

- Users with different roles and permissions
- Custom roles with specific permission sets
- Permission groups with bundled permissions
- Approval workflows with multiple steps
- Content in various stages of approval

## Running Tests

To run the tests for Layer 5:

```bash
# Run backend tests
bun run test:backend -- permissions.test.ts roles.test.ts workflows.test.ts collaboration.test.ts

# Run E2E tests
bun run test:e2e -- roleManagement.spec.ts permissionGroups.spec.ts approvalWorkflows.spec.ts collaboration.spec.ts

# Run all Layer 5 tests
bun run test:layer5
```

Add this script to the root `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:layer5": "bun run test:backend -- permissions.test.ts roles.test.ts workflows.test.ts collaboration.test.ts && bun run test:e2e -- roleManagement.spec.ts permissionGroups.spec.ts approvalWorkflows.spec.ts collaboration.spec.ts"
  }
}
```
