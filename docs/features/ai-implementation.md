# AI Implementation

## Overview

Unity House incorporates AI features to enhance user experience and automate common tasks. This document outlines the AI implementations planned for the platform.

## AI Features

### Content Generation

AI-powered content generation helps users create engaging pages:

- **Page Templates**: AI-generated templates based on entity type and purpose
- **Content Suggestions**: Smart suggestions for content improvement
- **Auto-formatting**: Automatic formatting of pasted content

### Member Management

AI assists in member management workflows:

- **Automatic Categorization**: Suggest roles based on user profiles
- **Approval Recommendations**: Flag potential issues in user registrations
- **Engagement Analysis**: Identify active and inactive members

### Natural Language Search

Enhanced search capabilities using natural language processing:

- **Semantic Search**: Find content based on meaning, not just keywords
- **Entity Recognition**: Identify people, places, and events in content
- **Query Understanding**: Parse natural language queries into structured searches

## Implementation

### OpenAI Integration

The platform integrates with OpenAI's API for advanced language processing:

```typescript
// Implementation in packages/api/convex/ai/openai.ts
import { action } from "../_generated/server";
import { v } from "convex/values";
import OpenAI from "openai";

export const generatePageTemplate = action({
  args: {
    entityType: v.string(),
    purpose: v.string(),
    tone: v.optional(v.string()),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const openai = new OpenAI({
      apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
    });

    const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: "gpt-4",
      messages: [
        {
          role: "system",
          content: "You are a helpful assistant that generates page templates for Greek organizations.",
        },
        {
          role: "user",
          content: `Generate a page template for a ${args.entityType} with the purpose of ${args.purpose}. Tone: ${args.tone || "professional"}.`,
        },
      ],
    });

    return response.choices[0].message.content;
  },
});
```

### Vector Database for Search

Content is indexed in a vector database for semantic search:

- Pages are embedded using OpenAI's embedding models
- Vector search finds semantically similar content
- Results are ranked by relevance and filtered by permissions

### AI-powered Analytics

The platform uses AI to analyze user engagement and content performance:

- Content popularity and engagement metrics
- User activity patterns
- Membership trends and retention analysis

## Security and Privacy

AI implementations follow strict security and privacy guidelines:

- No PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is used for training
- User data is anonymized before processing
- AI features are opt-in with clear user consent
- All AI processing complies with relevant privacy regulations

## Configuration

AI features can be configured at the organization level:

```typescript
// AI settings in organization schema
settings: v.optional(
  v.object({
    // Other settings...
    aiFeatures: v.optional(
      v.object({
        enableContentSuggestions: v.optional(v.boolean()),
        enableAutoTemplates: v.optional(v.boolean()),
        enableSemanticSearch: v.optional(v.boolean()),
      })
    ),
  })
),
```

## Future AI Enhancements

Planned future AI features include:

1. **Event Recommendations**: AI-suggested events based on member interests
2. **Automated Reporting**: Generate reports on organization activities
3. **Personalized Dashboards**: Customized views based on user behavior
4. **Smart Notifications**: Context-aware notifications prioritized by relevance
